Didn't Explored JS to this level.. thanks youtube and traversy media.

Okey,

This JS script uses Bootstrap Jumbotron template for Design. All we did is used Chromes Local storage to input the Tag of the website and the url to be bookmarked by the user.
No, JQUERY no tough DBMS storage fundamentals just pure JS. All this is gonna do is from the feeded set of links, the <division> tag is gonna get created with 2 buttons to 
open the link directly onclick and to delete the link and tag. Even though one may close the bookmark page, then also even after the closing the bookmarks shall appear.
